= PIL Interaction =

New to version 0.5, support for the [http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/ Python Imaging Library]. Now you can create a chart and fetch the PIL image instance of that chart to display however you please. The GChart.image method now returns a PngImageFile instance of the chart. You must install the [http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/ Python Imaging Library] to use these features. The PIL has other image manipulation features like image blending and filtering which can be found in the [http://www.pythonware.com/library/pil/handbook/image.htm PIL Handbook]

== API ==

The Python API extends the GChart main class, but can be used for any subtype.

{{{

# Create a simple Google-O-Meter with a label
>>> G = Meter(70)
>>> G.label('Hello')
>>> G.size(225,125)
>>> G
'http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chl=Hello&chs=225x125&cht=gom&chd=t:70.0'

# Now fetch the PngImageFile
>>> G.image()
<PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile instance at 0xb795ee4c>

# Now that you have the image instance, the world is your oyster
# Try saving image as JPEG,GIF,etc.
>>> G.image().save('google-o-meter.jpg','JPEG')
}}}

== CGI ==

Run a CGI application to serve (proxy) the chart image created

{{{
from GChartWrapper import Meter
G = Meter(70)
G.label('Hello')
G.size(225,125)

print 'Content-type: image/png'
print

print G.image().tostring()
}}}
